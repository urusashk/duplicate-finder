The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a Duplicate File Finder system 
that utilizes the Pigeonhole Principle to efficiently detect and eliminate redundant files from 
a given dataset. The project aims to demonstrate how mathematical principles can be applied 
in computer algorithms to improve performance and storage optimization. 
3. Expected Outcomes 
By the end of the project, students will: 
* Understand the application of the Pigeonhole Principle in solving real-world 
computational problems. 
* Implement an algorithm to identify duplicate files based on file size, name, or hash 
values. 
* Develop skills in Python programming and data handling. 
* Learn to optimize file storage and improve system efficiency. 
* Gain practical knowledge of algorithm design and analysis.
